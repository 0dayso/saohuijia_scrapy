The trend is set to continue, increasing a further15 percent by the middle of this century.<br/>Increasedprosperity in the region, mainly in China, along withchanging diets and demand for more protein-rich foods, arelargely responsible for the increases in demand andconsumption. But even without the increased consumption inChina, the region still consumed three-times more meatduring the same period. Japan, for example, increased percapita meat consumption from nearly 33 kg in themid-1980’s to more than 41 kg in the late 1990’s, whileits net imports quadrupled and self-sufficiency fell byaround one-third.<br/>“The elephant in the room is thepopulation explosion in the region, and not only in terms ofhuman population, but also animal populations in food andagriculture,” said Dr. Juan Lubroth, FAO’s ChiefVeterinary Officer, during a meeting at the Organization’sRegional Office for Asia and the Pacific. “The demand formore meat products is driving an industry to have thoseproducts ready for purchase in the markets but there arerisks associated with this.”<br/><strong>Under-regulatedand unmonitored – a breeding ground for newdiseases</strong><br/>“Much of the growth in livestock forhuman consumption (in Asia and elsewhere) has beenunregulated so the systems in place to ensure food safetyand consumer confidence, the protection of human and animalhealth, and prevention of existing transboundary diseasesand newly emerging ones, have not been well addressed. Thisweakness in the system has its consequences that manifestthemselves in the spread of new and existing diseases,”Lubroth said.<br/>More than 70 percent of all transmittablehuman diseases are contracted from animals (zoonosis), andas animal production for human consumption increases in EastAsia, so too does the threat of newly emerging pathogensthat can spread between animals and people and cross borderseven before symptoms begin to appear.<br/>“Because of therampant appearance of both new and old diseases, and theeasy way that they can move across borders through liveanimals or commodities and across value chains, it isimportant that everyone – from governments to farmers toretailers – takes action to improve levels of diseaseprevention and response. To get vaccines to livestockproducers in rural areas has a cost. And so a typicalapproach to a sick animal is sell it before it dies,”Lubroth added. “What’s really needed is for health andagriculture authorities to work more closely together onboth human and animal health in a holistic way to addressthe gaps that allow these diseases to spread. That will takedetermination and resources, but it’s in everyone’s bestinterests.”<br/><strong>FAO and partners inaction</strong><br/>In the Asia-Pacific region, FAO operatesthe <a href="http://www.fao.org/emergencies/emergency-types/transboundary-animal-diseases/en/" target="_blank">Emergency Centre for Transboundary AnimalDiseases (ECTAD)</a> and is actively working with FAO membercountries to prevent the spread of new and old diseases andmitigate risks.<br/>FAO is also working with the World HealthOrganization (WHO) and the World Organisation for AnimalHealth (OIE) to advocate a One Health approach (e.g. actionsto holistically benefit humans, animals and theenvironment). The three agencies recently launched a <a href="http://www.fao.org/asiapacific/news/detail-events/en/c/449850/" target="_blank">region-wide campaign</a> to raise awarenessabout<a href="http://www.fao.org/antimicrobial-resistance/en/" target="_blank">antimicrobial resistance (AMR)</a> and theresulting ill effects seen in both humans and animals due tothe misuse and abuse of antibiotics.<br/>Across theAsia-Pacific region, FAO specialists work closely withcounterparts in government, in laboratories and farmer fieldschools, helping to refine policies and build capacity toimprove animal health and food safety at all levels.<br/> <a href="http://www.fao.org/asiapacific/news/detail-events/en/c/469630/" target="_blank">http://www.fao.org/asiapacific/news/detail-events/en/c/469630/</a></p></body></html></div></body></html>',
