These agencies will amplify the campaign messages through their own networks,” adds Kathryn McCarrison. </p><p>“While the campaign messaging will be sector-focused – universities in China, tertiary education in India, and English language schools in Japan – agencies will advise prospective students on New Zealand education as a whole.”</p><p>“Using such a targeted approach allows us to refine our campaign messaging tightly – to be sure we’re reaching people already considering studying in New Zealand with information relevant to their home country in order to generate high quality enquiries.” </p><p>“It’s a formula we’re trialling with a view to repeating it in other countries.”</p><p>For more information about the first campaign off the block, read this story about the <a href="/news-and-research/ed-news/think-new-enters-china/"></a>. </p><p>You can see where it fits into New Zealand’s <a href="/markets/china/market-overview/" target="_blank">.</a></p><div class="share-wrapper"><div class="share"><h4>Share</h4><a class="btn btn-default facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://enz.govt.nz/news-and-research/ed-news/campaigns-go-live/"></a><a class="btn btn-default twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://enz.govt.nz/news-and-research/ed-news/campaigns-go-live/&amp;url=https://enz.govt.nz/news-and-research/ed-news/campaigns-go-live/&amp;via=nzeducated&amp;hash=educationnz"></a><a class="btn btn-default linkedin" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://enz.govt.nz/news-and-research/ed-news/campaigns-go-live/&amp;title=Campaigns+go+live"></a><a class="btn btn-default email" href="mailto:?subject=Campaigns+go+live&amp;body=https://enz.govt.nz/news-and-research/ed-news/campaigns-go-live/"></a></div><!-- end share --></div><!-- end intro-wrapper --></div><!-- end col --><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-1"></div><!-- end col --></div><!-- end row --></div></body></html></div></body></html>',
