CEO Marissa Mayer and four other directors currently on Yahoo's 10-member board will resign after the planned sale closes.</p> <p>But the Verizon deal has been jeopardized by Yahoo's recent discovery of two separate hacking attacks that stole personal information from more than 1 billion user accounts.</p> <p>In the only change that took effect Monday, Yahoo director Eric Brandt became the company's chairman. He replaces Maynard Webb, who becomes chairman emeritus until the Verizon deal closes.</p> <div class="disclaimer"><span class="apLogo floatLeft">AP</span><p>This story has been automatically published from the Associated Press wire which uses US spellings</p></div> </div></body></html></div></body></html>
